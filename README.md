# trígrafos
A word game! If you are given an arbitrary three-letter string, can you come up with a word that includes that string? Available in Spanish, Portuguese, and English.

Trígrafos is meant as a game for foreign language vocabulary stretching, so this repo features both game code and corpus-processing code (for making new language versions).

## How to run the game

[Download the game](http://github.com/settinger/trigrafos/zipball/master/) and unzip it. Then open main.py. If you have Python 2.something, it should run!

## How to play the game

First, select your language.

The game will give you three letters, such as *acu*, and prompts to you give a word that contains those letters in order (e.g. *facultad* or *acurrucarse*, meaning 'to snuggle'). You may want to have the special characters handy! That means *áéíóúñü* for Spanish and *áâãàéêíóôõúçü* for Portuguese. Also, your word must be five letters or more, just because. The better you do, the harder it gets (that is, the rarer the trigraphs become).

## Various notes
- The interface should not be in English.
- The Spanish frequency data is gleaned from [WikiCorpus Español](http://www.cs.upc.edu/~nlp/wikicorpus/), which is roughly 70 million tokens taken from the Spanish-language Wikipedia. Portuguese frequency data comes from the [Centro de Linguística da Universidade de Lisboa](http://www.clul.ul.pt/index.php).
- Especially with the WikiCorpus, there are some flaws&mdash;for example, it may want you to find words that contain *kéb* (answers: *pokéball(s)*, *pokéblock(s)*).
- The letter pairs *rr*, *ll*, *ch* and so on: they are counted as two letters each. This approach won't always work; for example, the Catalan *l·l* really has to be treated as a unigraph.
- I'm unhappy with the script I used to generate the Spanish trigraph frequencies.
- Maybe there should be a GUI? Or some easier way to input special characters.
